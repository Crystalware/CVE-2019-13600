# CVE-2019-13600

First zero day exploit. Targets AlphaAntiLeak, the software that was formerly protecting Lunar Client. Terrible software, would not use again. Elevates privileges to nt authority\system via a insecure service path.

UPDATE: I replaced the binary with the source code instead due to a request (a rather better one). Now, after a year of potential waiting, you can now see my first ever program written in C (horrendous, isn't it?)
