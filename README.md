# CVE-2019-13600
My first zero day. AlphaAntiLeak has yet to patch this vulnerability, so it's just out there for now.

Exploit Description: CVE-2019-13600 exploits AlphaAntiLeak (all versions) via improper permissions for both the AlphaAntiLeak service and installation directory. We are able to gain privilege escalation to SYSTEM by either a binary that automates this, or manual exploitation.
